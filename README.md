# Washing Machine Controller - 80C552

This project simulates a washing machine using the **80C552 microcontroller** in **Keil MicroVision2**.  
It models the washing process through **state machines** and **event-driven programming**, 
handling cycles like washing, rinsing, and spinning based on input events.

## Features
- State machine implementation for washing cycles
- Event-driven control logic (start, pause, water level, door lock)
- Efficient management of microcontroller I/O
- Simulation in Keil MicroVision2 environment

## Technical Details
- Microcontroller: **80C552**
- Development IDE: **Keil MicroVision2**
- Concepts used: Finite State Machines, Event Handling, Embedded Systems Programming

## Academic Project
Developed in 2025 for the Computer Architecture course of the Computer Engineering in Management and Information Systems 
program at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), School of Engineering, Bilbao.
